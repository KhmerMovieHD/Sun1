"Man is limited
only by his imagination."

178
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:26,293
My father named me Jiuming,

179
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,046
which means ocean

180
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,589
or abyss.

181
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,968
My father and my sister

182

studying the ocean.

183

It wasn't until

184
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,808
they were both gone
that I began to wonder

185
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,644
what my purpose was.

186
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,605
But through Suyin's daughter Meiying,

187
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,315
I saw that there was a future.

188
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,610
I merged
my father's research institute

189

190

Her name is Haiqi.

She is the world's

We found her injured as a pup.

What were you doing
on that ship?

00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,532
Actually, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

330
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,868
Well, the Institute's mandate

331
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,328
is to protect the oceans, right?

332
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,790
We can't be a part
of any illegal activity.

333

Especially the illegal dumping
of radioactive waste.

336
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,758
You're taking
bigger and bigger risks

00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,092
each time you go out.

338
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,011
Well, I guess
we both know about that.

339
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,139
It's not the same.

340

With me,

341
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,225
there's a calculation
of risks.

352
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,691
[Meiying] Mom and Grandpa
talked about you all the time.

353
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,028
Nothing good I suppose.

354

See this scar?

356
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:42,747
When I was 11
my father was busy in the lab.

357
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,542
So I snuck out to swim with my
friends on the rocky shores...

358
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,419
and had to get nine stitches
as a result of it.

359
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,213
When I returned home my father
taught me a real lesson.

360
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,717
- Grandpa?
- Of course.

361
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,594
He was kind to you
because you're
his granddaughter,

362
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,639
but he was tough on me.

363
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:04,769
So after college,
I started a company.

364
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,231
I wanted to get away from him.

365
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:11,734
I hadn't had any contact
with your grandfather
for many years.

366
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:15,321
Then he asked your mum
to bring me this calligraphy.

367
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,157
"Dragon travelling
across the Four Seas."

368
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,994
I thought it was
a form of ridicule...

369
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:25,665
but I came to realize that
he wanted me to
find my own way.

[Meiying] No!

Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

647
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,978
[DJ] We've got nothing here.

648
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:44,815
Keep trying, DJ. Jess,
prep the rescue sub. Stat.

649
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,900
- Ugh, what happened?
- I don't know.

650
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:50,779
How do we know
if they're still alive?

651
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,156
Prep the rescue vehicle.

652
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,369
[DJ] Dive 1, Dive 2.
Do you copy?

653
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,329
Come on, Jonas.

- Meiying.
- [electricity crackles]

658
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,841
[Meiying] What happened?

659
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:11,967
[Jonas] Took a nasty hit.

660
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:15,095
Uncle Jiuming?

661
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,681
Where's Uncle Jiuming?

662
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:20,225
- Where is he?
- We can't raise him.

663
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,978
Hey. We work the problems
one by one.

664
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,272
We do what's in front of us...

[crying]

666
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:27,608
...and then we do
the next thing.

667
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,235
We're gonna be okay.

668
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,363
[Jess] Mac!

669
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,657
The rescue sub isn't working.

670
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,076
[over radio] <i>The battery array
was deliberately shorted out.</i>

671
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,411
<i>It looks like sabotage.</i>

672
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,496
How's that possible?

673
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,914
<i>This isn't a secure area.</i>

674
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,248
<i>There are 30 people
who work here.</i>

675
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,958
Well, how long to fix it?

676
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,377
It's the control boards, Mac.
There is no fixing it.

677
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,299
[Rigas] Try it now.

678
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:53,592
[Meiying] What's our status?

679
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,676
[Jonas] No comms, no heat.

680
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:57,554
We're losing air fast.

681
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,722
[Rigas] This isn't working.

682
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,098
Flood in my extra O2.

683
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:02,851
Already done.

684
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,145
[Sal] I've got one last idea.

685
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,147
Route the power
through the heating cell.

686

[radio static]

687

Mac, I got Dive 1.

688
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,741
- Jonas?
- [Jonas chuckles over radio]

689
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,368
Good to hear your voice, Mac.

690
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:21,620
<i>Not as good as it is
to hear yours, brother.</i>

691
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,121
<i>Talk to me.</i>

692
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,040
[smacks lips] It ain't good.

693
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,709
<i>Almost every system is down,
and we're losing air fast.</i>

694
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:30,629
We'll get into
the emergency dive suits...

695
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,922
and we're gonna need
a ride up.

696
00:35:33,549 --> 00:35:34,550
Jonas...

697
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,635
it's not gonna be possible.

698
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,555
What are you talking about?

699
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:41,431
<i>The battery array.
It shorted out</i>

700
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,392
<i>the control board
in the rescue sub.</i>

701
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,852
<i>We're investigating it now.</i>

702
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,314
Jonas?

703
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,692
Jonas, can you hear me?

704
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,070
<i>Jonas, we can't get to you.</i>

705

[breathing heavily]

706
00:35:58,949 --> 00:35:59,950
We're gonna walk.

707
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,412
We're gonna walk back
across the trench.

708
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,497
Make it into
that sea floor station.

709
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:07,040
<i>And we're gonna get inside.</i>

710
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,917
<i>And then we're gonna get
to the surface.</i>

711
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,420
Those suits have
two hours of air tops.

712
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,922
They're only designed
for brief extravehicular work.

713
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,341
We'll go slow and steady.
They'll hold.

714
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,218
It's three kilometers.

715
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,137
You'll be defenseless
out there.

716
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:21,972
What do you want from me, Mac?

717
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:24,600
This is what we got, and this
is what we're gonna do.

[breathing heavily]

719

the other half.

DJ, what's our time on Jonas?

00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,204
[DJ] Forty-one minutes
since they went dark.

776
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:33,580
At best,
it'll take another hour

Listen up.

We know there's some kind of
rogue operation in the trench.

780
00:39:38,627 --> 00:39:39,836
Now, some bastard's
got his fingers

in our operation here.

782
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:43,381
That sub was
definitely sabotaged,

783
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,966
so we've got a mole
on the station.

DJ, I want you to pull
all surveillance footage

We're gonna get

our own backs.

[Rigas] Ah,

[Jiuming] Nothing here.

<i>Your life is in my hands.</i>

1049
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:49,936
What are you doing, Jess?

1050
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,815
These are your friends.

Three of our friends are dead

You think
I'm gonna forget about that?

No, no, no, no, no!

Go ahead.

It's the only way
Meiying survives.

[Rigas] How do we
open the door?

1097
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,305

cut the comm link

Why would you go through
the airlock? There's no pod.

I'll swim to the airlock

You have no suit.
How could it work?

under pressure,

1107
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:52,451
so if he can force water
in his sinus cavities,

1108
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,995
he could survive 30,
maybe 60 seconds

1109
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:56,413
before he passes out.

1110
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,540
- It is possible.
- [breathes deeply]

1111
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,961
We work the problems
one by one.

[breathing heavily]

it's you.

[machine buzzes]

1118
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,247
[Meiying] Won't he be crushed
by the pressure?

1119
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,124
[Rigas] It doesn't work
like that.

1120
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:43,794
You don't see fish
wearing metal suits, do you?

1121
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,881
It's about air.
It reacts under pressure.

1122
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:49,550
And that's why he has to
blow it out of his sinuses.

Well, guess what?

00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:11,840
[in English] I spent two years

1136
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,677
after you
and your eco-freak buddies

had our ship seized.

1138

I thought about you
every single day.

1139
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,436
You don't even remember me,
do you?

1140
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,980
- Hmm?
- [breathes deeply]

There's a million scumbags

Yeah.
Meiying would have killed me.

[Meiying] Is that gonna be
a problem?

1240
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,429
[Jiuming] It's a hole
in the thermal layer.

1241
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:35,557
It must have been caused
by the mining explosions.

1242
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,017
It will seal up eventually.

Open up.

01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,068
they're definitely
gonna kill us.

1257
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:29,569
Okay, listen.
Here's the plan.

1258
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,488
On the count of three,
you'll open the door

1259
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,240
and I'mma pepper spray 'em.

1260
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,533
Right, and you'll shut the door
and you're gonna wait.

1261
01:06:34,533 --> 01:06:36,243
Then go out there
and use the Taser.

1262
01:06:36,243 --> 01:06:37,828
One, two, three.

Trouble.

1271

[Rigas] So, we're walking fast

a lot of determination,
which is great.

1273

But what exactly
is the plan here?

1274

They're armed and we're not.

So what are you thinking?

What are you thinking?

1278

You and I find Mac and DJ.

1279
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,972
Rigas, grab what you can.

1280
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,265
Secure a Zodiac
so we can get off this thing.

[exhales] Rock and roll.

- How's your eyes?
- My eye stings.

1291
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:20,764
[grunts] If we climb up
to the communications array,

1292
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:23,016
we can bypass the DCC
and we can call for help.

1293

What are we supposed to say?

1294

Uh... terrorist action?

- Yeah, good. Terrorist action.
- Yeah, terrorist action.

[grunts] You got Tasers?
Now you can swim?

All of a sudden you run around

- Hell yeah.

Yeah, all right. Bet.

But I ain't stupid.

1316
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,252
I trained up,
I learned how to fight,

1317

I learned how to swim,

1318
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,922
and I will never go anywhere
without my survival pack.

- Yeah.

but I think, between trackers
and gunships,

1386
01:12:26,468 --> 01:12:28,511
we can solve the problem

Hey, yo, my man.
You got a phone?

What the hell was that?

1598
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:30,905
[Jonas] Three megs.

1599
01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:32,073
Three of us.

1600

We each grab a jet ski.

1601
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:34,867
Get them to chase it away

1602
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,869
from these people
and out to sea.

1603
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,162
Then we harpoon them.

1604
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:39,747
Oh, you mean
with those jerry-rigged,

Yeah.

1607
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:45,002
It's a terrible idea.

1608
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,170
You got a better one?

1609
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:47,380
No. No.

1610
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,006
- Then we're agreed.
- Yeah.

Okay, coast is clear.
Let's go.

It's those things.

They haven't spotted us yet.

Different kind of emergencies.

1639
01:24:25,895 --> 01:24:26,979
Hand me that.

1640
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,109
Now hand me
that gum in your mouth.

1641

Give me your harpoons.

You sure?

Let's go.

Not this time, Taylor.

Ammonium nitrate.

You're making a bomb?

Okay, Rigas.

On the count of three,
we're gonna bolt.

Come on. Come on.
Come here. Come here.

Up against the wall.
Hands up!

1689

I wouldn't point that at me

Trust me.

Shut it!
Keep your hands in the air.

We have to lead it away
and steal the chopper.

1730

Okay, you lead it away,
I'll steal the chopper.

1731

You distract it,
I'll get the chopper.
