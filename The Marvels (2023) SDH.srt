804
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:32,634

into each other?

805

Yeah, yeah, but
Dar-Benn only has one.

816
00:42:57,101 --> 00:42:59,699

overloading it

she's using it to force

into the grid.

MONICA: Here is
what we do know.

894
00:46:19,242 --> 00:46:21,399
The Universal Neural
Teleportation Network

895
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:22,699
is a system of wormholes

896
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:23,805
through the
space-time continuum

897
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,432
aka, jump points,

898
00:46:25,568 --> 00:46:27,868
which allows us to
hop between different
planetary systems.

899
00:46:28,003 --> 00:46:30,238
Basically, it stretches
and reconfigures space

900
00:46:30,374 --> 00:46:32,139
without rupturing
the continuum.

901
00:46:32,275 --> 00:46:34,908
Like fracking,
the more holes you drill,

902
00:46:35,044 --> 00:46:37,135
the more destabilized
the shale becomes,

903
00:46:37,271 --> 00:46:38,767
and then... earthquake.

904
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:43,107
Bottom line, if she
keeps creating
these jump points,

905
00:46:43,243 --> 00:46:45,172
it's gonna get really bad,
really fast.

906
00:46:45,308 --> 00:46:48,438
Question is,
what does she want?

907
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,040
Tarnax used to be
occupied by the Kree,

908
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,240
so maybe the attack
was a warning?

909
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:55,440
So, she could be after
another former colony?

910
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:57,173
Is there
a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

911
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:58,937
CAROL: At one point,
the Kree colonized

912
00:46:59,073 --> 00:47:01,403
25% of the galaxy, so...

913
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:03,471
If all she wanted
was to destroy Tarnax,

914
00:47:03,607 --> 00:47:06,365
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

915
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:07,736
Why a jump point?

916
00:47:07,872 --> 00:47:09,139
You're right.
Jump points
aren't weapons,

917
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:10,599
they're means
of transportation.

918
00:47:10,735 --> 00:47:12,273
Every jump point
has two sides,

919
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:15,238
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away,

920
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:17,767
it had to go
somewhere, or...
